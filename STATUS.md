# Shared project handoff — atrium.earth

Setup date: 2026-09-19. This section records repository setup, not a full application audit.

## Repository identity

- Repository: https://github.com/never-nude/atrium.earth
- Default branch observed: `main`.
- Scope: this repository only. Related versions are not automatically interchangeable.

## Evidence and current state

README describes the Astro sculpture museum. Inspect current source and deployment configuration before application work.

README.md was inspected for project context (observed blob `512ea6af19a98afa7d6e0b28e9ddf1dc7ce5f345`). Its existing statements are not new runtime verification.

## Handoff setup

- Task: shared Codex context across this chat and two computer checkouts.
- Owner of this documentation task: ChatGPT Codex session.
- Setup branch: `codex/shared-handoff-20260919`.
- Changes: AGENTS.md session-start/session-finish rules plus this status record; application code unchanged.
- Validation: checked availability of root instructions and status; preserved existing documents/history. No application runtime tests were performed for this documentation-only task.
- Delivery: check the setup pull request in GitHub for merge status. If these changes are on the remote default branch, they are integrated there; this does not establish deployment success or local computer synchronization.

## Unverified local work

Neither computer's checkout, uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, local paths, running tasks, nor separate Codex conversations has been inspected. Do not mark either machine synchronized based on these files alone.

## Next session

1. Read AGENTS.md and existing project instructions.
2. Inspect the local remote/branch and preserve pending work; fetch and safely integrate the shared default branch.
3. Record discovered unfinished work, its branch, actual validation, and next step here. Reconcile it with remote history before implementation.
4. At task completion, update this handoff and publish it through the existing repository workflow when authorized.

## 2026-09-19 — 35 reviewed sculpture additions

- Task/owner: Atrium acquisition session in local Codex, publishing at the user's explicit request. Publication work was isolated in a detached worktree; the earlier working checkout was preserved. The other computer's local state has not been inspected.
- Base: application commit `4633a40134cb79a7cc1c3cde44d6993944669dbf`, followed by shared handoff commit `4e72b06cc472877cfa28023fdfc4c0190878ae67`. The concurrent handoff changes were incorporated before publication. Current user authorization covers site publication and supersedes the June handoff's harvesting-only workflow for this task.
- Completed: 35 new 3D works, real rendered thumbnails, provenance and license records, explicit size-review statuses, and six additions to existing exhibitions. All 1,224 prior catalog entries and existing assets/settings are preserved. Five new works have documented unknown production locations and use the existing Unfiled route. Newest Additions remains neutral and shows only the current batch.
- Validation: immutable source hashes and eligible licenses for all 35; four-angle geometry review; final thumbnails; asset verification; addition grouping; wing routing; museum-label tests; production build; browser checks of all 35 newest links and interactive samples for Canova, Summers and Zariņš. Browser checks recorded no page errors or failed asset requests. Local and uploaded Git trees were compared.
- Known baseline issue: the full physical-dimensions test encounters 147 older public works without explicit review entries, beginning with `americas/lewitt-cubic-modular-wall-structure`. All 35 new dimension entries pass separate validation; prior dimension records were preserved. No physical-scale calibration was added.
- Remaining acquisitions: of 50 discoveries, 12 await actual source files and three scans are held for missing or uncertain surfaces. Exact identities and reasons are in `docs/ingest/new-additions-20260919.json`. These 15 are not counted as published works.
- Delivery: this changeset is the authorized publication of batch `new-additions-20260919`. Production deployment must be verified against its GitHub Pages run; local checks alone do not establish that it is live.
- Next step: verify the deployed batch at `/newest/`; retain the 12 download leads and three scan holds for future acquisition work. No state is inferred for another machine's checkout.
