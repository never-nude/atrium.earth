# AR and VR viewing

Each public sculpture page has a **View in AR / VR** button. The existing screen viewer remains available on computers, tablets, and phones, including devices without immersive support. The feature reuses the loaded sculpture, its authored surfaces, and the reviewed orientation.

## Viewing modes

- **WebXR AR:** Detect a horizontal floor or table and tap to place the work. Adjust display size, turn it, or place it again. Camera access starts only after an explicit click and the device's permission flow.
- **Apple Quick Look:** Prepare an on-device USDZ export, then use the explicit Open in AR link. The exporter preserves the displayed skeletal pose, material groups, and mirrored surface orientation. The live model and source assets are unchanged.
- **WebXR VR:** The sculpture stands on the floor two meters ahead of the initial reference origin. Walk around it, use a controller trigger to turn it, and move a controller thumbstick up/down to resize it. The headset's normal system controls can end the session; an Exit control is also available when the device supports DOM overlays.
- **Screen:** Rotate, zoom, and inspect the original Three.js view as before. Unsupported AR/VR modes show instructions for opening the canonical work link on a compatible device.

Display size is adjustable, with a default longest dimension of one meter. It is not claimed to reproduce the original artwork's physical measurements.

## Lifecycle and loading

Capability detection does not request an immersive session. `requestSession` runs directly in the user's button event. While WebXR owns the renderer, the screen animation and orbit controls pause. Ending, denying, cancelling, or interrupting a session restores the original model hierarchy, camera, floor, background, and screen rendering. AR wall hits do not place sculptures sideways. DOM overlay controls suppress duplicate XR select events.

Quick Look loads its exporter only when requested and creates a local blob URL. It bakes posed vertices into a temporary static copy, splits multi-material meshes for USDZ, and reverses winding when flattening a mirrored transform. The visitor makes a second explicit tap to launch Quick Look after preparation.

## Validation

`npm run test:spatial` checks floor contact at different scales, wall rejection, controller actions, session errors and cancellation, return to the original screen state, and Quick Look geometry for skinned, mirrored, and multi-material meshes.

With an Astro preview running, `ATRIUM_TEST_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4332 node scripts/test-spatial-browser.mjs` checks real screen rendering, desktop/mobile layouts, unsupported-device messages, canonical link copying, permission rejection, and an actual USDZ export of the Sutra Container. The browser tests emulate capability responses; they do not substitute for a physical headset or AR phone test. Real hardware testing remains outstanding.

Model-normalization and wing checks, catalogue asset verification, and the production build also pass. The collection remains at 1,046 public works. Video-sharing work is saved separately outside this release at the owner's request.
